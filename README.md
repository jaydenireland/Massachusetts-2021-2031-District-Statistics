# Massachusetts 2021- 2031 District Statistics

This data was taken from this page https://malegislature.gov/Redistricting/NewDistricts/Senate where it was only provided in a PDF form using images.

I gathered the data by cropping the pdf pages to the data table and running OCR over them.

You can find the images of the tables in images/ and the OCR'd results in txt/.

The data is available as a csv in senate-data.csv
